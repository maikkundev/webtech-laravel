## Privacy Protection Features

### Anonymous User Identification

- **anonymous_id**: A SHA-256 hash generated from user ID, username, and password hash
- This ensures user privacy while maintaining consistency across the export
- Same user will always have the same anonymous_id in different exports

### Minimal Personal Information

- **name_initials**: Only first and last name initials (e.g., "JD" for "John Doe")
- No usernames, emails, or full names are exposed
- No sensitive personal information is included

### Content Filtering

- **All playlists** are included in the export (both public and private)
- Each playlist includes a **visibility** field indicating "public" or "private"
- No sensitive personal information is exported
- User data is anonymized but playlist content is preserved

## Data Integrity

- All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with timezone information
- YouTube video URLs are reconstructed for easy access
- Playlist and video IDs are preserved for reference
- Creation and modification timestamps provide temporal context

## Use Cases

This open data format enables:

- Research on music listening patterns
- Analysis of playlist creation trends
- Development of music recommendation systems
- Academic studies on user behavior (while preserving privacy)
- Data visualization and analytics projects
